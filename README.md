# Telco Churn Classification Project

by Jeremy Lagunas 07/14/2022

## Project Outline
This project will follow the Data Science Pipeline. All steps of of this pipeline will be documented for review and implementation. The planning phase will be documented on this README. Other steps will be documented on a working notebook, the final report, or their own deliverable as necessary.
The process will take place as follows: 

1. Plan
2. Acquire
3. Prepare
4. Explore
5. Evaluate
6. Model
7. Deliver

# Plan

## Project Description
I will be working with the Telco dataset to accomplish gaining an underestanding of the company's churn drivers and what can be done to address them. 

## Initial Questions
- What drives churn?
- Which factors can be used to accurately predict churn?
- What actionable items can be taken to address the churn drivers?

## Initial Hypothesis
The high churn rates are related to high costs paid by the customers. 

## Project Goals
- Find churn drivers
- Compare churn drivers
- Generate visuals to communicate this information
- Generate models which can accurately predict churn
- Communicate recommendations/next steps to take with regard to addressing customer churn

# Steps to Reproduce
1. You will need an env.py file which has the host name, username, and password of the mySQL database that contains the telco_churn database. Store the env file locally in the repo.
2. Clone my repo. Confirm .gitignore is hiding your env file. 
3. Import libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn)
4. Run Telco_Report
